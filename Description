# Description

**Tools and Technologies**

For this project, we plan to use the following tools and technologies:

Python - The primary programming language for scripting and automation.
Unstructured - A Python library for extracting information from various document formats.
LangChain - A library for building applications with large language models.
Ollama - An AI platform for integrating and managing AI services.
Llava - A tool for visual understanding, specifically for explaining images.
Jupyter Notebook - For interactive development and testing of code.
Matplotlib - For creating visualizations and flowcharts.
Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.

**Explanation of the Diagram**

Start

The process begins.
PDF Input

The PDF document is provided as input.
Pass PDF into partition_pdf

The PDF is processed using the partition_pdf function from the Unstructured library to divide it into its components.
Extract Image Information

Image information (such as metadata) is extracted from the PDF.
Extract Image and Image Information

The actual images and additional information are extracted from the PDF.
Explain Image using Llava via Ollama and LangChain

The extracted images are passed to the Llava tool via Ollama and LangChain to get a detailed explanation or analysis of the images.
End

The process completes.

**Implementation Steps**

Setup Environment

Install necessary libraries (unstructured, langchain, ollama, llava, matplotlib, pandas).
Set up a Jupyter Notebook for development.
Load PDF

Write a script to load the PDF document using a library like PyPDF2 or pdfminer.
Partition PDF

Use the partition_pdf function from the Unstructured library to break down the PDF into its components (text, images, etc.).
Extract Image Information

Extract metadata and other relevant information about the images present in the PDF.
Extract Images

Extract the actual images from the PDF and save them to a temporary directory.
Analyze Images with Llava

Pass the extracted images to Llava via Ollama and LangChain.
Retrieve detailed explanations or analyses for each image.
Visualize Process

Create visualizations to depict the flow of data and the operations performed at each step.
Use Matplotlib to generate the flowchart.
Review and Validate

Validate the extracted and analyzed data to ensure accuracy.
Review the process for any possible improvements or optimizations.
Document the Process

Document each step of the implementation process.
Prepare a detailed report on the findings and results.
Deploy and Maintain

Deploy the solution as a script or a service.
Maintain and update the solution as necessary based on feedback and new requirements.
